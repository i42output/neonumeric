# neonumeric
Free C++ library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic (permissive software license).

Features:

* Multiple precision integers, floats and rationals.
* Numbers can be any fixed size (specifiable as a template parameter) or can dynamically grown in size.

This new project is, as of March 2021, still a work-in-progress so **DO NOT USE** until v1.0 has been released with a full suite of unit tests.
