# neonumeric
Free C++ library for arbitrary precision arithmetic (permissive software license).

Features:

* Arbitrary precision integers, floats and rationals.
* Numbers can be any fixed precision (specifiable as a template parameter) or can dynamically grow in precision based on the precision of operands.
* Header only with no dependencies on external libraries.

This new project is, as of March 2021, still a work-in-progress so **DO NOT USE** until v1.0 has been released with a full suite of unit tests.
